  This Italian-inspired flatbread makes a perfect side for soups or can be used as a pizza base. Cassava flour gives it an authentic texture that's hard to achieve with other AIP-compliant flours. The herbs can be adjusted based on your preferences. Store in an airtight container for up to 3 days or freeze for longer storage.

1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. In a large bowl, combine cassava flour, salt, and dried herbs.

3. Add olive oil and 3/4 cup warm water. Mix until a dough forms.

4. If needed, add more water, one tablespoon at a time, until dough comes together but isn't sticky.

5. Place dough on the lined baking sheet and press into a rectangular shape about 1/4 inch thick.

6. Use a fork to poke holes across the surface of the dough.

7. Brush the top with olive oil and sprinkle with minced garlic and a pinch of additional salt.

8. Bake for 18-20 minutes until edges are golden and bread is cooked through.

9. Allow to cool slightly before cutting into pieces.

10. Optional: For a crispier flatbread, place under the broiler for 1-2 minutes after baking.
