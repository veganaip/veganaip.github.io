  This satisfying burrito bowl combines homemade cassava tortilla bowls with jackfruit "carnitas" and cilantro-lime cauliflower rice for a complete AIP-friendly Mexican-inspired meal. The tortilla bowls can be made ahead and stored in an airtight container for up to 2 days. For a quicker version, you can purchase pre-made cassava tortillas and shape them into bowls, or simply serve all components in a regular bowl.

### For the Cassava Tortilla Bowls:

1. In a large bowl, whisk together cassava flour, arrowroot powder, and sea salt.

2. Add warm water and olive oil, and mix until a smooth dough forms. If too dry, add water 1 tablespoon at a time; if too sticky, add cassava flour 1 tablespoon at a time.

3. Divide the dough into 4 equal parts and roll each into a ball.

4. Heat a large, non-stick skillet over medium heat and add a small amount of olive oil.

5. Place one ball of dough between two pieces of parchment paper and press or roll into a circle about 8 inches in diameter.

6. Carefully transfer to the hot skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes per side until lightly browned with some darker spots.

7. While still warm and pliable, drape the tortilla over an inverted, oven-safe bowl and gently press to form a bowl shape. Place in a 300°F (150°C) oven for 5-7 minutes to set.

8. Repeat with remaining dough balls.

### For the Jackfruit "Carnitas":

1. Drain and rinse the jackfruit, removing any tough core pieces. Shred the jackfruit with two forks or your hands.

2. Heat avocado oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add diced onion and sauté for 3-4 minutes until translucent.

3. Add minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.

4. Add shredded jackfruit, dried oregano, cinnamon, and cumin (if using). Stir to combine.

5. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

6. Add coconut aminos and lime juice. Continue cooking for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until jackfruit is tender and slightly caramelized.

### For the Cilantro Lime Cauliflower Rice:

1. In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat.

2. Add riced cauliflower and sauté for 5-7 minutes until tender but not mushy.

3. Remove from heat and stir in half the chopped cilantro, lime zest, and half the lime juice. Season with salt to taste.

### For the Simple Guacamole:

1. In a bowl, mash the avocados with a fork.

2. Mix in red onion, remaining cilantro, remaining lime juice, and olive oil. Season with salt to taste.

### To Assemble:

1. Place a cassava tortilla bowl on each plate.

2. Fill the bottom with cilantro lime cauliflower rice.

3. Top with jackfruit carnitas.

4. Add a generous spoonful of guacamole.

5. Garnish with additional fresh herbs.
