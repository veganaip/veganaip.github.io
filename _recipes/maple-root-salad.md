notes: |
  This hearty salad combines the earthy sweetness of roasted root vegetables with the brightness of fresh greens. The maple glaze provides a delicious caramelization, while the tigernuts add a satisfying crunch. This makes an excellent side dish or a complete meal on its own. The root vegetables can be roasted ahead of time and served at room temperature.

### For the Roasted Vegetables:

1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).

2. In a large bowl, combine sweet potatoes, beets, carrots, and parsnips.

3. In a small bowl, whisk together 3 tablespoons olive oil, maple syrup, cinnamon, and 1/2 teaspoon sea salt.

4. Pour the maple mixture over the vegetables and toss to coat evenly.

5. Spread vegetables in a single layer on two large baking sheets, ensuring they're not overcrowded.

6. Roast for 25-30 minutes, stirring halfway through, until vegetables are tender and caramelized around the edges.

7. Remove from oven and let cool slightly.

### For the Dressing and Assembly:

1. While vegetables are roasting, place torn kale in a large bowl.

2. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and a pinch of salt. Massage the kale with your hands for 2-3 minutes until it starts to soften and turn a deeper green.

3. In a small bowl, whisk together remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, apple cider vinegar, minced garlic, and 1/4 teaspoon sea salt.

4. When ready to serve, combine the roasted vegetables with the kale.

5. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss gently to combine.

6. Sprinkle with fresh herbs and sliced tigernuts.

7. Serve warm or at room temperature.

8. Optional: Add a drizzle of additional maple syrup just before serving for extra sweetness.
