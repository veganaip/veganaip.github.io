notes: |
  This refreshing tropical green smoothie is perfect for a quick breakfast or energizing snack. The bright tropical fruits mask the flavor of the greens, making this an excellent option for those new to green smoothies. Using frozen fruit creates a thick, creamy texture without the need for ice. For a more substantial breakfast, add a tablespoon of tigernut flour or coconut yogurt for extra nutrition and thickness.

1. Place all ingredients except coconut water and ice in a high-speed blender.

2. Blend on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 30-60 seconds.

3. Add coconut water as needed to achieve desired consistency - less for a thicker smoothie, more for a thinner one.

4. If using ice, add now and blend again until smooth.

5. Pour into glasses and serve immediately.

6. Optional: Garnish with a pineapple wedge, a sprinkle of shredded coconut, or a mint leaf.

7. For meal prep: Prepare smoothie packs by dividing all ingredients (except liquids) into individual freezer bags or containers. When ready to enjoy, just add contents to blender with liquid and blend.
