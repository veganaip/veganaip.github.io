These naturally sweet cookies feature tigernut flour for a delicious nutty flavor and tender texture. Perfect for satisfying your sweet tooth while staying AIP-compliant.

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. In a large bowl, whisk together cassava flour, coconut flour, tigernut flour, arrowroot starch, carob powder (if using), salt, baking soda, and cinnamon.

3. In a separate bowl, mix melted coconut oil and coconut sugar until well combined. Add maple syrup if using.

4. Gradually add dry ingredients to wet ingredients, mixing well.

5. Add warm water 1 tablespoon at a time until you reach a workable cookie dough consistency.

6. Roll dough into balls (about 1-2 tablespoons each) and place on prepared baking sheet.

7. Flatten slightly with the palm of your hand or a fork.

8. Bake for 10-12 minutes at 350°F.

9. Let cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.

### Tips
- The increased tigernut flour provides natural sweetness and better nutrition
- Tigernut flour is rich in resistant starch and fiber
- These cookies will have a tender texture that's pleasantly soft
- If dough seems too wet, add a bit more cassava flour 1 tablespoon at a time
- Store in an airtight container for up to 5 days
