  These AIP-friendly tortillas are made with green plantains, creating a pliable yet sturdy vessel for tacos, wraps, or as a side with your favorite dishes. The key is using very green, unripe plantains - they should be firm and have a green peel without yellow spots. These tortillas can be made ahead and stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, separated by parchment paper. Reheat briefly in a dry skillet before serving.

1. Peel the green plantains by making a shallow cut along the length of the peel, then removing the peel in sections. The greener the plantain, the harder it is to peel.

2. Cut the peeled plantains into 2-inch chunks and place in a food processor.

3. Add melted coconut oil, sea salt, and lime zest (if using) to the food processor.

4. Process until a smooth, thick dough forms, scraping down the sides as needed. If using, add cassava flour and pulse a few more times to incorporate.

5. Divide the dough into 8 equal portions and roll each into a ball.

6. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add a small amount of coconut oil.

7. Place a ball of dough between two pieces of parchment paper. Rub a little olive oil on your hands to prevent sticking.

8. Using a tortilla press or the bottom of a heavy, flat-bottomed pan, press the dough into a thin circle (about 5-6 inches in diameter).

9. Carefully peel off the top piece of parchment paper, then flip the tortilla onto your hand and gently peel off the second piece of parchment.

10. Transfer the tortilla to the hot skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side until golden brown with some darker spots.

11. Repeat with remaining dough, adding a small amount of oil to the pan for each tortilla.

12. Keep tortillas warm by wrapping in a clean kitchen towel or place in a tortilla warmer until ready to serve.

13. Optional: For softer tortillas, wrap the stack in a damp paper towel and microwave for 20-30 seconds just before serving.
