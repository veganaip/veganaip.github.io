These crispy onion pakoras use a thick batter method with minimal oil for a healthier version of the classic Indian snack. Perfect for tea time or as an appetizer.

### Instructions

#### For Shallow Frying:

1. Thinly slice onions and soak in cold water for 10 minutes. Drain thoroughly and pat dry with paper towels.

2. In a bowl, mix singoda flour, arrowroot starch, turmeric, sea salt, garlic powder, and ginger powder.

3. Add apple cider vinegar and just enough cold water (6-7 tablespoons) to make a very thick, almost dough-like batter that holds its shape when scooped.

4. Fold in the onion slices and cilantro, ensuring they're well coated.

5. Heat 3-4 tablespoons of coconut oil in a heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat.

6. Drop 2-tablespoon portions of the mixture into the pan, slightly flattening with the back of the spoon.

7. Cook for 3-4 minutes per side until deep golden brown and crispy.

8. Drain on paper towels and serve hot.

#### For Baked Version:

1. Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).

2. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and brush with 1-2 tablespoons coconut oil.

3. Follow steps 1-4 from above, making the batter slightly thicker.

4. Drop 2-tablespoon portions onto the oiled parchment, pressing to flatten to about ¼ inch thick.

5. Brush tops with a little more coconut oil.

6. Bake for 15 minutes, carefully flip, then bake another 10-12 minutes until crispy and golden brown.

### Tips
- Singoda flour performs better than most grain-free flours for achieving crispiness
- The baked version will be lighter and slightly drier than fried, but still delicious
- Ensure onions are thoroughly dried for maximum crispiness
- Serve immediately with coconut yogurt or chutney
