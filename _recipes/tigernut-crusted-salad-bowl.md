### For the Tigernut-Crusted Sweet Potatoes:

1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. In a small food processor or using a knife, finely chop the tigernuts until they resemble coarse breadcrumbs.

3. In a medium bowl, mix together the chopped tigernuts, arrowroot powder, dried oregano, dried thyme, garlic powder, and sea salt.

4. Place the sweet potato cubes in a separate bowl and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of avocado oil. Toss to coat evenly.

5. Working in batches, dredge the sweet potato cubes in the tigernut mixture, pressing gently to adhere.

6. Place the coated sweet potato cubes on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them evenly.

7. Drizzle with 1 more tablespoon of avocado oil.

8. Bake for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the sweet potatoes are tender and the coating is golden brown and crispy.

### For the Lemon Herb Dressing:

1. In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, minced fresh herbs, and maple syrup (if using).

2. Season with salt to taste.

### For the Salad Bowl:

1. Divide the mixed greens between two serving bowls.

2. Arrange cucumber, radishes, red onion, and avocado slices over the greens.

3. Once the sweet potatoes are cooked, let them cool slightly, then place on top of the salad.

4. Drizzle with the lemon herb dressing.

5. Optional: Garnish with additional fresh herbs or a sprinkle of chopped tigernuts for extra crunch.
