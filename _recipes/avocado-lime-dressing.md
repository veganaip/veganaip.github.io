  This creamy, tangy avocado lime dressing is perfect for salads, as a dip for vegetables, or as a sauce for tacos and bowls. The bright flavor comes from fresh lime and cilantro, while the avocado creates a rich, velvety texture. For best results, use perfectly ripe avocados. This dressing will keep in the refrigerator for 3-4 days - press plastic wrap directly onto the surface to prevent browning.

1. Cut avocados in half, remove the pits, and scoop the flesh into a blender or food processor.

2. Add lime juice, olive oil, cilantro, garlic, apple cider vinegar, green onions, and a pinch of sea salt.

3. Blend until smooth and creamy, stopping to scrape down the sides as needed.

4. With the blender running, slowly add coconut milk until the dressing reaches your desired consistency. For a thinner dressing, add more coconut milk one tablespoon at a time.

5. Taste and adjust seasoning, adding more salt or lime juice if needed.

6. Transfer to a glass jar or container with a tight-fitting lid.

7. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving to allow flavors to meld.

8. Optional: Add a pinch of garlic powder or a small jalape√±o (seeds removed) for extra flavor.
