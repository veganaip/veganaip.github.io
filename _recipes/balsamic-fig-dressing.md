  This rich, sweet-tart dressing transforms ordinary salads into something special. Made with dried figs for natural sweetness and depth of flavor, it pairs beautifully with bitter greens, roasted vegetables, or any hearty salad. The balsamic vinegar provides a rich tang while staying AIP-compliant (just be sure to check your vinegar's ingredients). This dressing will keep in the refrigerator for up to 10 days - just bring to room temperature and shake well before using.

1. Place dried figs in a small bowl and cover with hot water. Let soak for 10 minutes to soften.

2. Drain the figs, reserving the soaking water.

3. In a small saucepan, combine the soaked figs, 2 tablespoons of the soaking water, and balsamic vinegar.

4. Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat and cook for about 5 minutes, until the figs have softened further and the mixture is slightly reduced.

5. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.

6. Transfer the fig mixture to a blender or food processor. Add minced shallot, garlic, dried thyme, and sea salt.

7. Blend until smooth, about 30-60 seconds.

8. With the blender running on low speed, slowly drizzle in the olive oil until fully incorporated and emulsified.

9. Taste and adjust seasoning, adding maple syrup if desired for additional sweetness.

10. If the dressing is too thick, add 1-2 tablespoons of the reserved fig soaking water or plain water to reach desired consistency.

11. Transfer to a glass jar or bottle with a tight-fitting lid.

12. Store in the refrigerator for up to 10 days. Bring to room temperature and shake well before using.

13. Serve over salads, roasted vegetables, or as a marinade for grilled vegetables.
