notes: |
  This AIP-friendly minestrone soup reimagines the Italian classic without tomatoes or legumes. The root vegetables provide a rich base, while the beets give a beautiful color and depth that traditionally comes from tomatoes. A hearty, comforting meal that's perfect for batch cooking and freezes well. Serve with a side of cassava flatbread or enjoy on its own.

1. Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onions, carrots, and celery, and saut√© for 5-7 minutes until softened.

2. Add garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.

3. Add grated beets and stir to combine, cooking for 2-3 minutes.

4. Add zucchini, butternut squash, and sweet potato. Stir to coat with oil.

5. Pour in vegetable broth and bring to a boil. Add dried herbs, reduce heat to low, and simmer covered for 25-30 minutes until vegetables are tender.

6. Add apple cider vinegar and stir to combine.

7. Season with sea salt to taste.

8. Ladle into bowls and garnish with fresh parsley and basil.

9. Optional: For a more authentic minestrone texture, cook some AIP-compliant pasta like cassava or sweet potato noodles separately and add to individual bowls when serving (this prevents the pasta from absorbing too much broth and becoming mushy).

10. Optional: Drizzle each serving with a little extra virgin olive oil for richness.
