notes: |
  This AIP-friendly version of the classic Thai green papaya salad (som tam) substitutes traditional ingredients like fish sauce and peanuts with AIP-compliant alternatives. The result is a bright, refreshing salad with the perfect balance of sweet, sour, and savory flavors. Green papaya can be found in Asian markets - look for firm, unripe papaya with green skin. If you can't find green papaya, you can substitute with daikon radish or jicama for a similar crunchy texture.

1. In a large bowl, combine shredded green papaya, julienned carrots, and cucumber.

2. Add the sliced water chestnuts to the bowl with the papaya mixture.

3. In a separate small bowl, make the dressing by whisking together minced garlic, lime juice, coconut aminos, and maple syrup.

4. Pour the dressing over the vegetables and toss well to combine.

5. Gently fold in the fresh herbs, reserving some for garnish.

6. Season with sea salt to taste.

7. Let the salad sit for 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.

8. Serve chilled, topped with sliced tigernuts and the remaining fresh herbs.

9. Optional: For a spicier version (if reintroduced), add a small amount of ginger to the dressing.
