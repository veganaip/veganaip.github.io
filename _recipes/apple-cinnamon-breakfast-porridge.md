  This warming breakfast porridge is perfect for cold mornings and provides a comforting alternative to oatmeal for those on an AIP diet. The combination of tigernut flour and coconut creates a pleasing texture, while the apple and cinnamon flavors are reminiscent of apple pie. For variety, try topping with different fruits like berries or sliced bananas.

1. In a small saucepan, combine tigernut flour, coconut flour, and salt, stirring with a whisk to remove any lumps.

2. Gradually whisk in coconut milk and applesauce until smooth.

3. Add cinnamon and maple syrup, and stir to combine.

4. Heat the mixture over medium-low heat, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming.

5. Cook for about 5-8 minutes, or until the porridge thickens to your desired consistency. If it gets too thick, add a splash more coconut milk.

6. Remove from heat and let stand for 2 minutes to thicken further.

7. Serve in bowls, topped with diced fresh apple, a drizzle of coconut oil, sliced tigernuts, and an extra sprinkle of cinnamon.

8. Optional: For additional sweetness, drizzle with a little extra maple syrup just before serving.
