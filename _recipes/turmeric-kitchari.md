notes: |
  This AIP-friendly version of the traditional Indian healing dish kitchari uses cauliflower rice instead of mung beans and rice. Turmeric and ginger provide anti-inflammatory properties, making this a nourishing, gut-friendly meal. Leftovers will keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 days and actually improve in flavor over time.
