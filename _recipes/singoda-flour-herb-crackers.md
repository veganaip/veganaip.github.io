Mix ingredients to form a stiff dough. Roll thin between parchment paper, score into squares, and bake at 325°F for 15-20 minutes until crisp.

These crispy herb crackers are perfect for snacking or serving with dips. The singoda flour provides a unique nutty flavor and crisp texture.

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325°F (165°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. In a mixing bowl, combine singoda flour and sea salt.

3. Add olive oil and warm water to the flour mixture. Mix until a stiff dough forms.

4. Finely chop your chosen fresh herbs and fold into the dough.

5. Place dough between two sheets of parchment paper and roll out as thin as possible (about 1/8 inch thick).

6. Remove top parchment and use a knife or pizza cutter to score the dough into 1-2 inch squares.

7. Bake for 15-20 minutes until edges are golden and crackers are crisp.

8. Allow to cool completely on the baking sheet before breaking apart along score lines.

### Tips
- For extra flavor, brush tops with olive oil and sprinkle with coarse sea salt before baking
- Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week
- Try different herb combinations like rosemary-thyme or sage-oregano
