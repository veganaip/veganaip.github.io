notes: |
  These AIP-friendly carnitas tacos use young green jackfruit to replicate the texture of pulled pork, while plantain tortillas provide an authentic vessel. Make sure to use young green jackfruit in water or brine (not ripe jackfruit in syrup). For a shortcut, you can use pre-made cassava or plantain tortillas if available.

### For the Jackfruit Carnitas:

1. Drain and rinse the jackfruit. Remove any hard core pieces and pull the jackfruit into shreds with your fingers or two forks.

2. Heat coconut oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onions and saut√© for 3-4 minutes until softened.

3. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

4. Add the shredded jackfruit, oregano, cinnamon, and salt. Stir to combine.

5. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

6. Add 1/4 cup water, cover, and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.

7. Remove lid and continue cooking for 10 more minutes until jackfruit is tender and most liquid has evaporated.

8. Use a wooden spoon to further shred the jackfruit as it cooks.

9. Once the jackfruit is tender and beginning to crisp on the edges, add lime juice and stir.

10. Turn heat to high and cook for 2-3 minutes to get some caramelization and crispy edges.

### For the Plantain Tortillas:

1. Peel green plantains and cut into chunks.

2. Place in a food processor with 1/4 cup water, 2 tbsp coconut oil, and 1/2 tsp salt.

3. Process until a smooth dough forms.

4. Divide into 8 equal portions and roll into balls.

5. Place each ball between two pieces of parchment paper and flatten into a thin circle (about 6 inches in diameter).

6. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat.

7. Cook tortillas for 2-3 minutes per side until cooked through with some brown spots.

8. Keep warm until ready to serve.

### To Assemble:

1. Fill each plantain tortilla with jackfruit carnitas.

2. Top with sliced avocado, fresh cilantro, and green onions.

3. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing over tacos.

4. Optional: Add AIP-compliant toppings like pickled red onions or fermented vegetables for extra flavor.
