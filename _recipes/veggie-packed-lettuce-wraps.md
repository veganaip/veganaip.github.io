notes: |
  These fresh, crunchy lettuce wraps use hearts of palm as a protein-rich filling that mimics the texture of traditional meat-based fillings. The combination of vegetables provides a variety of textures and flavors, while the sauce brings everything together with a tangy, slightly sweet finish. Perfect for a light lunch or dinner, these wraps can be partially prepared ahead - just store the filling and lettuce separately, then assemble right before serving.

1. Prepare the hearts of palm by draining well and using two forks to shred into small, stringy pieces. Set aside.

2. Heat avocado oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the white parts of the green onions, garlic, and ginger. Saut√© for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

3. Add the chopped mushrooms and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring frequently, until they begin to release their moisture.

4. Add the shredded hearts of palm, grated carrots, and diced water chestnuts. Cook for another 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally.

5. In a small bowl, whisk together coconut aminos, AIP fish sauce, maple syrup, and lime juice.

6. Pour the sauce mixture over the vegetable mixture in the skillet and stir to combine. Cook for another 2 minutes until everything is well heated and the sauce has slightly reduced.

7. Remove from heat and stir in half of the fresh herbs and the green parts of the scallions. Season with sea salt to taste.

8. To serve, lay out the butter lettuce leaves on a serving platter. Spoon the filling into each leaf, top with sliced avocado and remaining fresh herbs.

9. Optional: Serve with lime wedges for squeezing over the top.

10. To eat, fold the lettuce around the filling like a taco or roll up from the bottom like a wrap, tucking in the sides as you go.
