notes: |
  This crunchy, grain-free granola makes a perfect breakfast or snack. Tigernuts aren't actually nuts, but small tubers, making them completely AIP-compliant. This granola stores well in an airtight container for up to two weeks. Enjoy it with coconut yogurt, as a topping for smoothie bowls, or simply by the handful as a satisfying snack.

1. Preheat oven to 325°F (165°C) and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. In a large bowl, combine tigernuts and coconut flakes.

3. In a small saucepan over low heat, warm the coconut oil and maple syrup until melted and combined. Remove from heat and stir in cinnamon, ginger powder (if using), sea salt, and vanilla extract.

4. Pour the liquid mixture over the dry ingredients and stir thoroughly to coat everything evenly.

5. Spread the mixture in an even layer on the prepared baking sheet.

6. Bake for 20-25 minutes, stirring halfway through, until golden brown and fragrant. Watch carefully in the last few minutes to prevent burning.

7. Remove from oven and let cool completely on the baking sheet (it will crisp up as it cools).

8. Once cooled, mix in the dried cranberries, chopped apricots, and banana chips.

9. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.

10. Optional: Add other AIP-compliant mix-ins like dried blueberries, dried mango, or additional toasted coconut for variety.
