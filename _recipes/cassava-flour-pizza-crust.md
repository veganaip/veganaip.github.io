  This AIP-friendly pizza crust gives you that satisfying pizza experience without grains, dairy, or yeast. The cassava flour provides a neutral flavor base while arrowroot powder adds elasticity. The crust can be par-baked and frozen for quick weeknight pizzas - just add your favorite AIP toppings and finish baking. Try topped with nomato sauce, vegetables, and if permitted, a sprinkle of nutritional yeast for a cheesy flavor.

1. Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. In a large bowl, whisk together cassava flour, arrowroot powder, garlic powder, dried oregano, salt, and nutritional yeast (if using).

3. Set aside 1/4 cup of the warm water in a small bowl. Add the additional tablespoon of arrowroot powder (if using), whisk until dissolved.

4. Add olive oil, remaining warm water, apple cider vinegar, and the arrowroot mixture (if using) to the dry ingredients.

5. Mix until a dough forms, first with a spoon and then with your hands. The dough should be pliable but not sticky. If too dry, add a tablespoon of water at a time; if too sticky, add a tablespoon of cassava flour.

6. Place the dough on the parchment-lined baking sheet and cover with another piece of parchment paper.

7. Using your hands or a rolling pin over the top parchment, press or roll the dough into a circle about 1/4 inch thick.

8. Remove the top parchment and shape the edges to form a slight rim.

9. Brush the entire crust with a thin layer of olive oil.

10. Par-bake the crust for 10-12 minutes until the edges start to turn golden.

11. Remove from oven, add your desired AIP-compliant toppings, and return to the oven for another 8-10 minutes until toppings are cooked and crust is golden brown.

12. For a crispier crust, brush the edges with a little more olive oil before adding toppings.

13. Allow to cool slightly before slicing to ensure the crust sets properly.
