This doubled recipe creates a larger, well-risen loaf perfect for sandwiches and toast. Using the normal cycle instead of quick baking allows for better fermentation and rise.

### Instructions

1. **Check water temperature**: Ensure water is 105-110°F (40-43°C) for optimal yeast activation.

2. **Order of ingredients for normal cycle**:
   - Add wet ingredients first: warm water, apple cider vinegar, olive oil, blackstrap molasses, and maple syrup
   - Mix dry ingredients separately in a bowl: cassava flour, tigernut flour, tapioca starch, coconut flour, arrowroot powder, salt, baking soda, thyme, and cinnamon
   - Add dry mixture on top of wet ingredients
   - Create a shallow well in the center of dry ingredients for the yeast, keeping it away from salt and vinegar

3. **Select normal cycle** on your bread machine (not quick cycle) for better rise and texture.

4. **Monitor consistency**: During the first 5-10 minutes of mixing, check that dough resembles thick cake batter. Add water or cassava flour as needed.

5. **Watch the rise**: The normal cycle's longer fermentation time will create more gas bubbles and better rise. If your machine has a window, monitor the first rise.

### Tips for Success

- **Normal vs Quick Cycle**: The normal cycle provides:
  - Longer rise time for better yeast fermentation
  - Multiple kneading phases to develop starch network
  - Gradual temperature progression for proper structure setting

- **Customization**: If your machine allows:
  - Minimize or disable the "punch down" phase
  - This helps maintain the rise in gluten-free breads

- **Expected Results**: With doubled recipe and normal cycle:
  - Significantly larger loaf
  - Better rise and texture
  - More complex, bread-like flavors from extended fermentation

### Storage
- Cool completely before slicing
- Store in airtight container for up to 3 days
- Freezes well for up to 1 month
