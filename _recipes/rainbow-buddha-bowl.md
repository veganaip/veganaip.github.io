  This vibrant rainbow buddha bowl is packed with colorful, nutrient-dense vegetables arranged in an appealing color gradient. The variety of textures and cooking methods - roasted, steamed, and raw - creates an interesting eating experience in every bite. For strict AIP, replace the tahini sauce with avocado or coconut cream-based dressing. This bowl is highly customizable, so feel free to substitute vegetables based on what's in season or available.

### For the Roasted Vegetables:

1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. Place sweet potato and beet cubes on one side of the baking sheet, and carrot sticks on the other side.

3. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon avocado oil and sprinkle with sea salt.

4. Roast for 25-30 minutes until tender and slightly caramelized, removing the carrots after about 20 minutes (they cook faster).

### For the Steamed Vegetables:

1. While the root vegetables are roasting, bring a pot of water to a boil with a steamer basket.

2. Add cauliflower florets to the steamer basket, cover, and steam for 5 minutes.

3. Add broccoli florets and continue steaming for another 3-4 minutes until both are tender but still have some bite.

4. Remove from heat and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process.

### For the Tahini Sauce (optional, omit for strict AIP):

1. In a small bowl, whisk together tahini, lemon juice, minced garlic, and maple syrup.

2. Gradually add warm water, 1 tablespoon at a time, whisking until the sauce reaches your desired consistency.

3. Season with salt to taste.

### For AIP-Compliant Alternative Sauce:

1. Mash half an avocado with lemon juice, minced garlic, and salt to taste.

2. Thin with a tablespoon of water if needed.

### To Assemble the Bowl:

1. Divide the following between two bowls, arranging in sections or in a rainbow pattern:
   - Roasted sweet potatoes, beets, and carrots
   - Steamed cauliflower and broccoli
   - Sliced red cabbage
   - Cucumber slices
   - Avocado slices

2. Drizzle with tahini sauce or avocado sauce.

3. Sprinkle with fresh herbs and sliced tigernuts.

4. Serve immediately, or store components separately for meal prep and assemble just before eating.
