1. Peel and roughly chop the zucchini.

2. In a food processor or high-powered blender, combine zucchini, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, salt, turmeric, and garlic powder.

3. Process until completely smooth, stopping to scrape down the sides as needed.

4. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.

5. Transfer to a serving bowl and chill for at least 30 minutes to allow flavors to develop.

6. Before serving, drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with fresh herbs.

7. Serve with vegetable sticks like carrot, cucumber, or celery for dipping.

8. Optional: For a thicker consistency, place the peeled and chopped zucchini in a clean kitchen towel and squeeze out excess moisture before processing.
