  These crispy-on-the-outside, fluffy-on-the-inside cassava waffles are the perfect weekend breakfast treat that's completely AIP-compliant. The cassava flour provides a neutral base that works beautifully with sweet toppings. For best results, make sure your waffle iron is well-heated before adding the batter. Leftover waffles can be frozen and reheated in a toaster for quick weekday breakfasts.

1. Preheat your waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.

2. In a large bowl, whisk together cassava flour, arrowroot powder, salt, and cinnamon (if using).

3. In a separate bowl, combine coconut milk, melted coconut oil, maple syrup, and vanilla extract.

4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until smooth. The batter should be thick but pourable - if it's too thick, add a tablespoon or two more coconut milk.

5. Brush the preheated waffle iron with coconut oil. Pour about 1/3 cup of batter (or the amount recommended for your waffle iron) onto the center of the iron.

6. Close the lid and cook until the waffle is golden brown and crisp, about 4-5 minutes depending on your waffle iron.

7. Carefully remove the waffle and repeat with the remaining batter.

8. Serve warm, topped with whipped coconut cream, fresh berries, and a drizzle of maple syrup.

9. Optional: For extra decadence, add sliced banana or a sprinkle of tigernuts for crunch.
