  This AIP-friendly "nomato" sauce uses root vegetables to create a rich, savory alternative to traditional tomato-based marinara sauce. Perfect for pasta dishes, as a pizza sauce, or as a base for stews. The sauce can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or frozen in individual portions for up to 3 months.

1. Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onions and saut√© for 3-4 minutes until translucent.

2. Add garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.

3. Add beets, carrots, and sweet potato. Stir to coat with oil.

4. Pour in vegetable broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 25-30 minutes until vegetables are very tender.

5. Add dried herbs and continue to simmer for 5 more minutes.

6. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.

7. Transfer the mixture to a blender or use an immersion blender to puree until completely smooth. Be careful with hot liquids in a blender - work in batches if needed and allow steam to escape.

8. Return the pureed sauce to the pot and add apple cider vinegar. Simmer for another 5-10 minutes to allow flavors to meld.

9. Season with sea salt to taste.

10. Serve hot, garnished with fresh basil.

11. Optional: For a smoother sauce, strain through a fine mesh sieve before serving.
