notes: |
  This dairy-free ranch dressing uses coconut milk for creaminess while herbs and spices create that classic ranch flavor. Refrigerating the coconut milk helps separate the cream for a thicker dressing. Great on salads, as a veggie dip, or as a sauce for roasted vegetables. Will keep in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

1. Place your can of coconut milk in the refrigerator overnight to allow the cream to separate and solidify at the top.

2. Open the can and scoop out the thick coconut cream from the top (about 1 cup), leaving the watery liquid behind (save this for smoothies or other recipes).

3. In a blender or food processor, combine the coconut cream, olive oil, apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, minced garlic, onion powder, dried dill, dried parsley, sea salt, and nutritional yeast (if using).

4. Blend until completely smooth and creamy, about 30-60 seconds.

5. Taste and adjust seasonings if needed, adding more salt, herbs, or lemon juice to taste.

6. Transfer to a glass jar or airtight container.

7. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving to allow flavors to meld and dressing to thicken.

8. If dressing becomes too thick after refrigeration, thin with 1-2 tablespoons of cold water and whisk until desired consistency is reached.

9. Store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Shake or stir well before using.
