notes: |
  This AIP-friendly gnocchi recreates the taste and texture of traditional Italian gnocchi using sweet potatoes and cassava flour. The result is pillowy soft pasta with a delicious sage sauce. The gnocchi can be made ahead and frozen before cooking - just place them on a baking sheet until solid, then transfer to a freezer bag. Cook from frozen by adding an extra minute to the boiling time.

### For the Gnocchi:

1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Prick sweet potatoes all over with a fork, place on a baking sheet, and bake for 45-60 minutes until very tender.

2. Allow sweet potatoes to cool slightly, then peel and place the flesh in a large bowl. Mash thoroughly until smooth.

3. In a separate bowl, mix 1 1/2 cups cassava flour, arrowroot powder, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.

4. Add the flour mixture to the mashed sweet potatoes and gently mix until a soft dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, add more cassava flour, 1 tablespoon at a time.

5. Dust a clean surface with cassava flour. Divide the dough into 4 equal portions.

6. Roll each portion into a rope about 3/4 inch thick. Cut into 1-inch pieces.

7. Optional: Roll each piece along the tines of a fork to create traditional gnocchi ridges.

8. Place the formed gnocchi on a cassava-floured baking sheet. At this point, you can either cook immediately or freeze for later use.

### For Cooking and Sauce:

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

2. Meanwhile, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.

3. Add minced garlic and sauté for 1 minute until fragrant but not browned.

4. Add chopped sage and cook for 30 seconds more.

5. Add the coconut milk cream and stir to combine. Reduce heat to low to keep warm.

6. When water is boiling, gently add gnocchi in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pot.

7. Cook gnocchi until they float to the surface, about 2-3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and add directly to the sauce.

8. Once all gnocchi are cooked and added to the sauce, gently toss to coat. If sauce seems too thick, add a tablespoon or two of the gnocchi cooking water.

9. Sprinkle with nutritional yeast if using, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt (or to taste), and fresh herbs.

10. Serve immediately.
