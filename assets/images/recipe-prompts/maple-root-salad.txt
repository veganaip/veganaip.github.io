A beautiful maple glazed root vegetable salad served on a large oval platter with a white or light-colored background to showcase the vibrant colors of the vegetables. The roasted vegetables - sweet potatoes, beets, carrots, and parsnips - have a caramelized exterior with a glossy maple glaze that catches the light. The colors are vibrant: orange sweet potatoes, deep purple-red beets, bright orange carrots, and cream-colored parsnips, all arranged over a bed of dark green massaged kale. The vegetables are cut in uniform chunks and have visible roasted edges. A light drizzle of dressing is visible on top, with sliced tigernuts scattered throughout for texture. Fresh herbs add bright green accents. The platter sits on a rustic wooden table with a small jar of additional dressing and a maple syrup bottle visible in soft focus in the background. Natural lighting comes from the side, highlighting the glazed, caramelized edges of the vegetables. Food photography style, with an overhead angle to showcase the beautiful arrangement of colorful vegetables.
