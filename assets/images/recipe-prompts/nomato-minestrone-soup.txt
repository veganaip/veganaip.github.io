A hearty minestrone soup in a rustic ceramic bowl, showing a rich, deep reddish-purple broth from the beets with chunks of colorful vegetables throughout. The soup is packed with visible pieces of orange carrots, orange-yellow butternut squash, white-orange sweet potato cubes, green zucchini, and celery. The broth has a slight glossy sheen from olive oil. Fresh herbs (parsley and basil) are sprinkled on top, adding bright green accents. A piece of cassava flatbread is propped against the side of the bowl. The soup is photographed from a 45-degree angle to show both the surface with its colorful vegetables and the depth of the bowl. Steam is rising gently from the soup, and a wooden spoon is partially dipped in, lifting some of the vegetables and broth to show the texture. The setting is a weathered wooden table with a folded linen napkin, a small dish of olive oil, and some fresh herbs in the background. The lighting is warm and directional, highlighting the vibrant colors of the vegetables and the rich hue of the broth. Food photography style with natural styling.
