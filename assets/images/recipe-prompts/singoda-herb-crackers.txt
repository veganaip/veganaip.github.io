A professional food photography shot of crispy golden-brown herb crackers arranged on a light wooden board. The square crackers show visible herbs (rosemary and thyme) baked into them, with a few crackers broken to show the crispy texture. Natural lighting from the side creates gentle shadows. A small bowl of olive oil and fresh herb sprigs are placed as props in the background. The crackers have a rustic, artisanal appearance with slightly irregular edges from hand-scoring. Shot from a 45-degree angle, shallow depth of field with the front crackers in sharp focus.
