Two Mexican-style tacos on golden plantain tortillas arranged on a colorful ceramic plate. The tacos are filled with shredded jackfruit carnitas that have a pulled-pork-like texture with caramelized edges - the jackfruit is seasoned to a rich golden-brown color with visible spices. Topped with slices of ripe avocado, fresh cilantro leaves, and thinly sliced green onions. The filling is slightly spilling out of the sides of the tacos, showing the juicy, textured jackfruit. Lime wedges are placed beside the tacos for squeezing over top. The plate sits on a vibrant Mexican-patterned table runner, with a small bowl of additional jackfruit carnitas visible in the background. The lighting is bright and natural, highlighting the fresh ingredients and colors. Food photography style, with the camera positioned at a 30-degree angle to show both the plantain tortillas and the filling of the tacos.
