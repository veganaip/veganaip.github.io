A beautiful salad bowl featuring tigernut-crusted sweet potato cubes on a bed of vibrant mixed greens. The sweet potato cubes are golden-brown with a visible textured coating, showing some crispy edges. They're arranged on top of a colorful salad base that includes bright green leafy vegetables, thin slices of radishes showing their pink edges, diced cucumber adding light green color, creamy slices of avocado, and thin ribbons of red onion. The salad is drizzled with a light golden dressing that pools slightly at the bottom of the bowl. The bowl itself is a neutral color (white, cream, or light wood) to highlight the vibrant colors of the ingredients. The composition includes some additional elements like a small container of the dressing nearby, perhaps a wedge of lemon, and a sprinkling of extra herbs. The lighting is bright and natural, coming from the side to create some shadows that highlight the texture of the tigernut crust on the sweet potatoes. The photo is taken from a 45-degree angle to show both the layers of the salad and the depth of the bowl. The background suggests a fresh, healthy meal setting, perhaps with a linen napkin or fresh herbs visible but softly blurred.
