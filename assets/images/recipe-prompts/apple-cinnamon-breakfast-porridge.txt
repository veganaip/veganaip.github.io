A warm, comforting bowl of apple cinnamon breakfast porridge served in a rustic ceramic bowl. The porridge has a creamy beige color with visible flecks of cinnamon throughout. On top is a beautiful arrangement of diced fresh apples, sliced tigernuts, and a drizzle of coconut oil that's creating a small pool in the center. A light dusting of cinnamon covers the surface. The bowl sits on a wooden table with a small jar of maple syrup and a spoon visible to the side. Steam is rising gently from the porridge, suggesting warmth. The lighting is soft and warm, coming from the side to create a cozy morning atmosphere. A folded linen napkin is partially visible beside the bowl. Food photography style, shot from a slightly elevated angle to showcase the toppings.
