A vibrant green tropical smoothie served in two tall clear glasses with wide straws. The smoothie has a beautiful gradient effect - deeper green at the bottom transitioning to lighter green at the top with a frothy layer on the surface. One glass is garnished with a small pineapple wedge on the rim and a mint leaf, while the other has a slice of mango. The glasses have condensation on the outside, suggesting a refreshing coldness. Around the glasses are some of the fresh ingredients: spinach leaves, pieces of bright yellow pineapple, orange mango chunks, and slices of banana. A small bowl of coconut flakes sits nearby. The scene is set on a light-colored surface (white marble or light wood) with natural, bright lighting that highlights the vibrant green of the smoothie and the colorful tropical fruits. The composition is clean and fresh-looking, styled like a high-end food magazine photograph. The camera angle captures the glasses from a slight side view, showing both the height of the smoothies and the ingredients scattered artfully around them.
