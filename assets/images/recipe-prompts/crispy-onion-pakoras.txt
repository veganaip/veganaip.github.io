A professional food photography shot of golden-brown crispy onion pakoras (fritters) arranged on a white ceramic plate. The pakoras show visible caramelized onion strands coated in a crispy batter, with an irregular, lacy texture. Some are broken open to reveal the tender onions inside. A small bowl of coconut yogurt garnished with fresh cilantro sits beside the plate for dipping. The pakoras have a beautiful golden color from turmeric, with crispy edges and appetizing texture. Natural window light creates soft shadows. Shot from above at a slight angle, with one pakora being dipped in the yogurt. Clean, bright styling with a light marble or white background.
