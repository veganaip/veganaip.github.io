A rich, deep red marinara-style sauce in a rustic white ceramic bowl. The sauce has a thick, smooth texture with small specks of herbs visible throughout. A silver serving spoon is partially immersed in the sauce, lifting a portion to show its consistency. Fresh basil leaves garnish the top of the sauce, adding vibrant green color contrast. In the background, there's a small bowl of additional fresh herbs and a bottle of olive oil. The sauce is photographed on a wooden table with a few drops of sauce and olive oil artfully placed around the bowl. A plate of vegetable "pasta" (like zucchini noodles or spaghetti squash) is partially visible to the side, showing how the sauce might be used. The lighting is warm and directional, emphasizing the rich color and glossy surface of the sauce. Food photography style, shot from a 45-degree angle to show both the depth of the bowl and the surface of the sauce.
