A beautiful cassava tortilla bowl filled with vibrant layers of Mexican-inspired AIP-friendly ingredients. The tortilla bowl has a golden-brown color with visible texture and a slightly irregular, handmade shape. Inside, the bowl is layered starting with pale green cilantro-lime cauliflower rice at the bottom, topped with shredded jackfruit "carnitas" that has a golden-brown, slightly caramelized appearance. Fresh, bright green guacamole is dolloped on top, with visible red onion pieces throughout. The bowl is garnished with fresh cilantro leaves and a lime wedge. The composition shows the bowl positioned on a rustic wooden or stone surface, with some additional ingredients artfully arranged nearby - perhaps a small bowl of extra guacamole, some lime wedges, or fresh herbs. The lighting is bright and natural, highlighting the vibrant colors and textures of each component. The camera angle captures the bowl from a 45-degree angle to showcase both the tortilla bowl shape and the layers of colorful fillings inside. The image has a fresh, appealing Mexican-inspired aesthetic with perhaps a colorful textile or napkin in the background.
