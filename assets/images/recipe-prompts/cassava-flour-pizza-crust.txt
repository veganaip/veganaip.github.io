A golden-brown cassava flour pizza crust on a pizza stone or baking sheet, photographed just after coming out of the oven. The crust has a perfectly round shape with a slightly raised edge that has browned nicely. The surface shows some characteristic bubbles and a few light brown spots, giving it an artisanal appearance. A pizza peel is partially visible, as if the pizza has just been removed from the oven. The crust has a light dusting of herbs visible on the edges. Part of the crust might be pulled slightly away to show its interior texture - soft yet sturdy. Around the pizza crust are a few ingredients that might be used as toppings - perhaps a small bowl of nomato sauce, some fresh herbs, and sliced vegetables, suggesting how it might be completed. A light dusting of nutritional yeast might be visible on part of the crust for the "cheesy" effect. The lighting is warm and directional, highlighting the golden color and texture of the crust, with some steam possibly rising from the hot surface. Food photography style, with the camera positioned at a 45-degree angle to show both the surface of the pizza crust and its thickness. The background suggests a warm, rustic kitchen setting.
