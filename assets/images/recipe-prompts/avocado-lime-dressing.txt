A creamy, pale green avocado lime dressing being poured from a small glass pitcher onto a colorful salad. The dressing has a smooth, glossy texture with tiny flecks of cilantro visible throughout. As it pours, it creates an artful drizzle over a vibrant salad of mixed greens, sliced radishes, cucumber, and colorful vegetables. Some of the dressing is also shown in a small clear glass bowl to the side, showing its thick, creamy consistency. Lime wedges and a halved avocado with its pit removed are artfully arranged nearby, along with some fresh cilantro sprigs. The colors are vibrant - the pale green dressing contrasting with the bright vegetables and dark greens. The lighting is bright and natural, highlighting the fresh ingredients and the velvety texture of the dressing. Food photography style, shot from a slight overhead angle to capture the pouring action and the beautiful arrangement of the salad and ingredients.
