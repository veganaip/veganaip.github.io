A platter of bright green butter lettuce wraps filled with a colorful vegetable mixture. The filling shows visible strands of shredded hearts of palm, orange grated carrots, white water chestnuts, and dark mushroom pieces, all glistening with a light sauce. Some of the wraps are assembled and ready to eat, while others are open, showing the generous filling. Slices of ripe avocado top some of the wraps, and fresh herbs (cilantro, mint) are scattered throughout. A small dish of extra sauce sits nearby, with a lime wedge on the side. One wrap might be lifted slightly off the platter, as if being picked up to eat, showing how the lettuce folds around the filling. The platter is set on a natural surface like wood or stone, with some additional butter lettuce leaves and fresh herbs arranged around it for garnish. The lighting is bright and natural, highlighting the vibrant colors and fresh ingredients. The photo is styled to look appetizing and healthy, with the camera positioned at a 45-degree angle to show both the assembled wraps and the filling inside the open ones.
