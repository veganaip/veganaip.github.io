A stack of golden-yellow plantain tortillas on a rustic wooden board or stone surface. The tortillas have a slightly irregular, handmade appearance with some brown spots from cooking. One tortilla is placed separately, partially unfolded to show its pliable texture. Next to the stack are some ingredients - a couple of green unripe plantains (one whole and one peeled), a small bowl of sea salt, and perhaps a lime. A small dish of coconut oil sits nearby. The tortillas might be arranged with some fresh herbs or vegetables that would typically accompany them, like cilantro or avocado slices. The lighting is warm and directional, highlighting the texture of the tortillas and giving them a golden glow. The composition has a rustic, Mexican-inspired feel with perhaps a colorful woven textile in the background. Food photography style, shot from a 45-degree angle to show both the stack of tortillas and their surface texture.
