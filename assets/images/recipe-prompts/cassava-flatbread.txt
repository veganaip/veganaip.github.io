An Italian herb cassava flatbread on a rustic wooden cutting board. The flatbread has a golden-brown color with visible herbs and minced garlic scattered across the top. The bread has a slightly irregular, artisanal shape with small bubbles and charred spots along the edges. A drizzle of olive oil gives it a slight sheen, and you can see flecks of dried rosemary, oregano, basil, and thyme throughout the bread. The flatbread is partially cut into triangular pieces, with one piece pulled slightly away to show the soft, airy interior texture. Next to the board is a small dish of extra virgin olive oil for dipping. The scene is set on a textured linen cloth with warm lighting from the side, creating shadows that highlight the bread's texture. A few fresh herb sprigs are artfully placed nearby for garnish. Food photography style, with a 45-degree angle view to showcase both the surface and the interior of the flatbread.
