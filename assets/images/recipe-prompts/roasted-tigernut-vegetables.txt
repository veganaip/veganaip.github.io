A beautiful array of roasted root vegetables on a large, rustic earthenware platter. The vegetables are caramelized with golden-brown edges - sweet potatoes with their bright orange color, carrots showing rich orange hues, and parsnips with their cream-colored flesh. Fresh rosemary sprigs are scattered among the vegetables, and there's a light sheen from the tigernut oil glaze. The vegetables have visible herbs and a light sprinkle of sea salt crystals. The platter is placed on a wooden table with a natural linen napkin nearby. The lighting is warm and directional, highlighting the caramelized edges of the vegetables. Food photography style, with a slightly elevated angle showing the full spread of colorful roasted vegetables.
