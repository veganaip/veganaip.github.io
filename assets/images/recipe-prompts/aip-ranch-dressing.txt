A creamy white AIP-friendly ranch dressing in a clear glass bottle with a cork stopper, showing the smooth, pourable consistency of the dressing. Some of the dressing is being drizzled onto a colorful salad in a wooden bowl, creating an appetizing motion shot with the dressing suspended mid-pour. The salad contains crisp romaine lettuce, purple cabbage, carrot strips, and cucumber slices. Surrounding the bottle are fresh herbs used in the recipe - dill, parsley, and garlic. A small bowl of the dressing sits nearby for dipping, with a celery stick partially dipped in. The scene is arranged on a light-colored marble or stone surface with natural, bright lighting that highlights the creamy texture of the dressing. Food photography style, with a slightly angled perspective to capture both the dressing bottle and the salad it's being poured onto.
