A plate of vibrant orange sweet potato gnocchi with sage sauce. The gnocchi pieces are small, pillow-like dumplings with the traditional ridge marks from a fork, showing their handmade quality. They have a rich orange color from the sweet potato. The gnocchi are coated in a creamy, light-colored sauce with visible flecks of chopped sage leaves and small pieces of minced garlic throughout. The sauce has a slight sheen from olive oil and coconut cream. Fresh sage leaves garnish the dish, along with a light sprinkle of nutritional yeast giving a "cheese-like" appearance. The plate is a simple white ceramic to contrast with the colorful gnocchi. A small fork is pulling away one piece of gnocchi, showing its soft, pillowy texture. The dish is photographed from a 45-degree angle with soft, natural lighting to highlight the colors and textures. Food photography style with a soft depth of field focusing on the gnocchi in the foreground.
