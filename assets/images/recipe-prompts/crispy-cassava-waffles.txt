A stack of golden-brown cassava waffles on a white ceramic plate. The waffles have crisp, defined edges with deep grid patterns and a fluffy interior visible where they've been sliced. A pool of amber maple syrup is drizzling down the sides of the stack, with some collected at the base of the plate. On top of the waffles is a generous dollop of white coconut cream that's starting to melt slightly. Fresh berries - blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries - are scattered around the plate and on top of the waffles, adding vibrant color. A fork is pulling away one piece of waffle, showing its light, airy texture inside. The setting includes a small glass pitcher of additional maple syrup and a cloth napkin in the background. The lighting is bright and warm, highlighting the crispy golden texture of the waffles and the glossy syrup. Food photography style, shot from a 45-degree angle to capture both the height of the stack and the details of the waffle texture.
