A rustic jar of golden-brown tigernut granola with the lid partially off, showing the crunchy clusters inside. Some granola is artfully spilled onto a wooden surface around the jar, revealing the various ingredients - sliced tigernuts, coconut flakes, pumpkin and sunflower seeds, and dried fruit pieces (cranberries and apricots) adding pops of color. A small bowl of the granola sits nearby, topped with a dollop of coconut yogurt and a drizzle of maple syrup that's catching the light. A small spoon rests in or beside the bowl. Some of the raw ingredients are arranged nearby - a small pile of sliced tigernuts, a few dried apricots, and perhaps a small dish of maple syrup. The lighting is warm and directional, highlighting the golden, toasty color of the granola and creating some gentle shadows. The composition has a homey, breakfast feel, perhaps with a folded linen napkin or a cup of herbal tea visible in soft focus in the background. Food photography style, shot from a slightly elevated angle to show both the contents of the jar and bowl, as well as the scattered granola.
