A professional food photography shot of soft, round chocolate-colored cookies made with carob powder arranged on a cooling rack. The cookies have a tender, slightly crackled surface showing their soft texture. A few cookies are stacked, with one broken in half to show the moist, cake-like interior. The deep brown color from carob gives them a rich, chocolatey appearance. A glass of coconut milk and scattered tigernut flour are visible in the soft-focus background. Warm, natural lighting from the side highlights the cookies' texture. Shot at eye level with shallow depth of field, creating an inviting, homey atmosphere. The cookies are about 3 inches in diameter with gently rounded tops.
