A professional food photography shot of a freshly baked gluten-free bread loaf, sliced to show the soft, airy crumb structure. The loaf has a golden-brown crust and a light, even texture inside. Several slices are arranged in a cascading pattern on a wooden cutting board, with one slice spread with coconut butter. The bread has a homemade appearance with a slightly domed top typical of bread machine loaves. Natural morning light streams in from the left, creating warm highlights on the crust. A bread knife with a wooden handle and a small jar of honey are placed as props. Shot from a 45-degree angle showing both the whole loaf and the sliced portions, with soft focus on the background. The bread appears moist and springy with a fine, even crumb.
