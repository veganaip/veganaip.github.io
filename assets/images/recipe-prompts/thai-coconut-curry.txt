A vibrant Thai coconut vegetable curry served in a deep white bowl. The curry has a creamy golden-yellow color with orange and green vegetables visible throughout - chunks of sweet potato, carrot slices, bright green broccoli florets, and bok choy leaves. Fresh herbs including cilantro and sliced green onions are sprinkled on top. The curry has a glossy appearance from the coconut milk, with a slice of lime on the side of the bowl. Chopsticks rest across one side of the bowl, and there's a small dish of lime wedges nearby. The scene is set on a dark wooden table with natural light highlighting the vibrant colors of the curry. The image is styled as professional food photography, with steam gently rising from the hot curry and a slightly angled perspective to showcase the vegetables and herbs.
