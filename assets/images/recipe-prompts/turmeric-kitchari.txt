A vibrant Indian turmeric kitchari bowl served in a handmade ceramic bowl with a deep blue exterior and cream interior. The kitchari has a golden-yellow color from the turmeric, with visible pieces of cauliflower rice, orange sweet potato cubes, carrot pieces, and green zucchini throughout. The texture looks moist and slightly creamy from the coconut milk. Fresh cilantro leaves are scattered on top as a garnish, adding bright green accents. A lime wedge rests on the side of the bowl. Next to the bowl is a small brass spoon and a folded piece of naan-inspired cassava bread. The scene is set on a natural wood surface with a small bowl of additional lime wedges and a sprinkling of fresh herbs nearby. Warm, directional lighting creates shadows that highlight the texture of the ingredients. Food photography style, with a slightly elevated angle to showcase the various vegetables and colors in the bowl.
