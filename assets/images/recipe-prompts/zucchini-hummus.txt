A creamy, pale green zucchini hummus in a shallow, handmade ceramic bowl. The hummus has a smooth texture with a swirl pattern on top creating a well that holds a pool of golden olive oil. Sprinkled across the surface are small specks of fresh herbs and a light dusting of turmeric giving a subtle yellow-gold color accent. The bowl sits on a Mediterranean-style serving platter surrounded by colorful vegetable crudit√©s for dipping - carrot sticks, cucumber slices, celery, and radishes arranged in a circular pattern. A few pieces of fresh herbs (mint or parsley) garnish the hummus. The setting is on a textured stone or concrete surface with natural light coming from the side, creating gentle shadows. A small wooden serving spoon rests beside the bowl. Food photography style, overhead view to showcase the beautiful arrangement of the dip and vegetables.
