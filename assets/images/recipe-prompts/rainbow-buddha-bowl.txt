A vibrant rainbow buddha bowl arranged in a large, shallow white bowl against a light neutral background. The vegetables are arranged in a color gradient or sections to showcase the rainbow effect: orange-gold roasted sweet potatoes, deep purple-red roasted beets, bright orange roasted carrot sticks, white steamed cauliflower, green steamed broccoli florets, bright purple-red shredded cabbage, and green cucumber slices. Slices of creamy green avocado add richness, while sliced tigernuts are sprinkled on top for texture. A light-colored creamy sauce (either tahini or avocado-based) is drizzled over portions of the bowl, with a small dish of additional sauce visible to the side. Fresh herbs (cilantro, mint, or parsley) add bright green accents throughout the bowl. The bowl sits on a natural surface like wood or stone, with perhaps some raw ingredients or kitchen tools artfully arranged in the background. The lighting is bright and natural to highlight the vibrant colors of all the vegetables. The photograph is taken from a slightly elevated angle to showcase the beautiful arrangement and color gradient of the vegetables within the bowl. The overall effect is fresh, colorful, and appetizing.
